# Advent of TypeScript 2023

I present to you my repository with solutions to tasks from [Advent of TypeScript 2023](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023).

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/testing-types.html) is utilized as the type-testing runner.

To install dependencies, use the command `pnpm install`
To run and verify the correctness of the test execution, use the command `pnpm test:ui` or `pnpm test`.
