## Naughty List Decipher

[_early on the morning of Thursday, December 14th, Santa stumbles into office greeted by Bernard, the head elf…_]

[_Bernard_] YOU'RE A MESS. Were you out partying… on a WEDNESDAY?? AGAIN??!!!

[_Santa_] It seems as such. Some investors were in town, so we went over to the Mistletoe Lounge and things got a little out of hand.

[_Bernard_] I oughta report you to HR. Seriously. This is getting out of control.

[_Santa_] We're like a family here; no need for formal HR processes!

[_Bernard_] Where's the list for today's naughty kids? We're behind on coal lump production.

[_Santa_] Umm.

[_Bernard_] You're joking. Tell me you're joking. You lost the list again?

[_Santa_] Well, not lost per se.

[_Bernard_] Then where is it?

[_Santa_] I have it… but I only scribbled down the names real quick with slashes in between them.

## Covering for Santa, again

Looks like we're gonna need to pick up the slack for Santa yet again. He's got a list like `"melkey/prime/theo/trash"` and we need to turn it into a union of strings `"melkey" | "prime" | "theo" | "trash"`.

Let's get this done before the rest of the elves find out.
