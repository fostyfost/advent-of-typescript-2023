## What is tic-tac-toe?

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game where players alternate marking ❌s and ⭕s in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row.

fun fact: Did you know that tic-tac-toe is widely considered to be the first computer video game ever created?! That's right! Sandy Douglas [implemented it](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OXO_(video_game)>) all the way back in 1952, the same year as the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

## Solving tic-tac-toe

Your goal for this challenge is to use TypeScript types to encode the game logic of tic-tac-toe. Eventually, every game will end with one of the players winning or a draw.
