## Is Santa Dyslexic?

[_it's early Saturday morning and the team has been working overtime. Santa storms into the factory floor shoutingâ€¦_]

[_Santa_] Don't you elves take any pride in your work?!?! Others would love to have your job for much less pay! I asked for a simple type that will reverse strings!! How hard is that?!? What do we even pay you for??

[_unfortunately, Santa is conveniently forgetting that the `Reverse` type was cut from the sprint (which... of course... he agreed to)_]

[_floor manager_] Ok. We never got acceptance criteria for that ticket.

[_Santa_] How difficult is it to understand what `Reverse` does!? `'rehsaD'` should be transformed into `'Dasher'`, `'recnaD'` should be transformed into `'Dancer'`, `'recnarP'` should be transformed into `'Prancer'`.. DO I NEED TO KEEP GOING?

[_floor manager_] Well you might be surprised. For example, what should happen to multi-codepoint unicode characters?

[_Santa_] What are you on about with all that accessibility stuff again!

[_floor manager_] Accessibility is important, sir.

[_Santa_] Look, this is just an MVP. We can add accessibility later. Just get me my `Reverse` type! I'm having a hard time reading this stuff otherwise!
